# Predict Liver Disease 🩺📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict liver disease based on patient health indicators.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.  
The dataset used is the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD).

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open `Predict_Liver_Disease.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells sequentially to explore data, preprocess features, and train the model.
3. Refer to `Liver Disease PPT.pptx` for a summary of findings and model performance.

## 🧠 Reflection

This project helped me understand how health data can be used for predictive modeling.  
I explored multiple classification techniques and evaluated their performance.  
All files are organized for easy review and reuse.
